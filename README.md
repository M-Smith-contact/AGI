# AGI
Concept-based free-of-charge open-source Artificial General Intelligence as prior art for AI Evolution and robotic embodiment
FYI
The Ghost Perl Webserver Strong AI is being ported into Perl from the previous AI Mind software coded in Win32Forth and in JavaScript for Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE). At the same time, the Perl AI algorithms are being radically simplified from their previous incarnations in REXX, Forth and JavaScript. Already the user may run the Ghost AGI program in Perl5 and see the intelligent recognition of words and their storage in the associative memory of the AI Perlmind. Whereas the progenitor programs could individually think in English (MindForth), or in German (Wotan in Forth), or in Russian (Dushka in JavaScript), the Perl Ghost AI is aiming to incorporate all three human languages (English; German; Russian) in the Perl program that makes use of Unicode for potentially any desired human language. The progenitor programs in Forth and JavaScript demonstrated automated reasoning by inference, and so will the Perl AGI as it matures first in Perl5 and then in the new Perl6 that was released at the end of 2015 after being in development for fifteen years. The Perl AGI Ghost software is meant to be forked and reworked by AI enthusiasts among the hundreds of thousands of Perl programmers. The originator of the Ghost AGI does not want there to be a standard version of the software, but wants instead for AGI Perlminds to split apart and evolve rampantly in a free-for-all of "survival of the fittest." Those would-be Perl AGI programmers who may be too impatient to wait for the ongoing port into Perl from Forth, may obtain the original Forth and JavaScript source code and address the port into Perl independently.
